# Demo using MVI Repository Pattern

1. Retrieve data from an api with [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/).
2. Cache data with [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room).
3. Display data in UI.

### Design Pattern
The project used MVI and Repository design pattern approach. State in app is defined by user's action which is called intent _(not the android Intent class)_ which the ViewModel will get and decide the state to be reflected to the View.

#### Libraries
* [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Dependency injection
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - Caching mechanism.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - API http network requests.
* [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) - Use as http client for logging interceptor.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - Smaller and faster JSON serialization.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - For screen navigation.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - Logging and crash reports.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loader to views.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/) - Google's material design ui.
